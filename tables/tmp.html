Sea water salinity is the salt content of sea <BR/>water, often on the Practical Salinity Scale of 1978. However, <BR/>the unqualified term 'salinity' is generic and does not necessarily <BR/>imply any particular method of calculation. The units of salinity <BR/>are dimensionless and the units attribute should normally be given <BR/>as 1e-3 or 0.001 i.e. parts per thousand. There are <BR/>standard names for the more precisely defined salinity quantities: sea_water_knudsen_salinity, <BR/>S_K (used for salinity observations between 1901 and 1966), sea_water_cox_salinity, <BR/>S_C (used for salinity observations between 1967 and 1977), sea_water_practical_salinity, <BR/>S_P (used for salinity observations from 1978 to the present <BR/>day), sea_water_absolute_salinity, S_A, sea_water_preformed_salinity, S_*, and sea_water_reference_salinity. Practical Salinity is <BR/>reported on the Practical Salinity Scale of 1978 (PSS-78), and <BR/>is usually based on the electrical conductivity of sea water <BR/>in observations since the 1960s. Conversion of data between the <BR/>observed scales follows: S_P = (S_K - 0.03) * (1.80655 <BR/>/ 1.805) and S_P = S_C, however the accuracy of <BR/>the latter is dependent on whether chlorinity or conductivity was <BR/>used to determine the S_C value, with this inconsistency driving <BR/>the development of PSS-78. The more precise standard names should <BR/>be used where appropriate for both modelled and observed salinities. <BR/>In particular, the use of sea_water_salinity to describe salinity observations <BR/>made from 1978 onwards is now deprecated in favor of <BR/>the term sea_water_practical_salinity which is the salinity quantity stored by <BR/>national data centers for post-1978 observations. The only exception to <BR/>this is where the observed salinities are definitely known not <BR/>to be recorded on the Practical Salinity Scale. The unit <BR/>"parts per thousand" was used for sea_water_knudsen_salinity and sea_water_cox_salinity. </TD><TD>CF-44 </TD><TD></TD></TR>

For observed data, depending on the period during <BR/>which the observation was made, the measured in situ temperature <BR/>was recorded against standard "scales". These historical scales include the <BR/>International Practical Temperature Scale of 1948 (IPTS-48; 1948-1967), the International <BR/>Practical Temperature Scale of 1968 (IPTS-68, Barber, 1969; 1968-1989) and <BR/>the International Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS-90, Saunders 1990; 1990 <BR/>onwards). Conversion of data between these scales follows t68 = <BR/>t48 - (4.4 x 10e-6) * t48(100 - t - <BR/>48); t90 = 0.99976 * t68. Observations made prior to <BR/>1948 (IPTS-48) have not been documented and therefore a conversion <BR/>cannot be certain. Differences between t90 and t68 can be <BR/>up to 0.01 at temperatures of 40 C and above; <BR/>differences of 0.002-0.007 occur across the standard range of ocean <BR/>temperatures (-10 - 30 C). The International Equation of State <BR/>of Seawater 1980 (EOS-80, UNESCO, 1981) and the Practical Salinity <BR/>Scale (PSS-78) were both based on IPTS-68, while the Thermodynamic <BR/>Equation of Seawater 2010 (TEOS-10) is based on ITS-90.

The measured conductance, corrected for temperature and pressure, <BR/>is compared to the conductance of a standard potassium chloride <BR/>solution, producing a value on the Practical Salinity Scale of <BR/>1978 (PSS-78). This name should not be used to describe <BR/>salinity observations made before 1978, or ones not based on <BR/>conductance measurements. Conversion of Practical Salinity to other precisely defined <BR/>salinity measures should use the appropriate formulas specified by TEOS-10. <BR/>Other standard names for precisely defined salinity quantities are sea_water_absolute_salinity <BR/>(S_A); sea_water_preformed_salinity (S_*), sea_water_reference_salinity (S_R); sea_water_cox_salinity (S_C), used for salinity <BR/>observations between 1967 and 1977; and sea_water_knudsen_salinity (S_K), used for <BR/>salinity observations between 1901 and 1966. Salinity quantities that do <BR/>not match any of the precise definitions should be given <BR/>the more general standard name of sea_water_salinity.

The data variable should have <BR/>an axis for X specifying the limits of the integral <BR/>as bounds. "wrt" means with respect to. "Layer" means any <BR/>layer with upper and lower boundaries that have constant values <BR/>in some vertical coordinate. There must be a vertical coordinate <BR/>variable indicating the extent of the layer(s). If the layers <BR/>are model layers, the vertical coordinate can be model_level_number, but <BR/>it is recommended to specify a physical coordinate (in a <BR/>scalar or auxiliary coordinate variable) as well. Depth is the <BR/>vertical distance below the surface. Sea water temperature is the <BR/>in situ temperature of the sea water. For observed data, <BR/>depending on the period during which the observation was made, <BR/>the measured in situ temperature was recorded against standard "scales". <BR/>These historical scales include the International Practical Temperature Scale of <BR/>1948 (IPTS-48; 1948-1967), the International Practical Temperature Scale of 1968 <BR/>(IPTS-68, Barber, 1969; 1968-1989) and the International Temperature Scale of <BR/>1990 (ITS-90, Saunders 1990; 1990 onwards). Conversion of data between <BR/>these scales follows t68 = t48 - (4.4 x 10e-6) <BR/>* t48(100 - t - 48); t90 = 0.99976 * <BR/>t68. Observations made prior to 1948 (IPTS-48) have not been <BR/>documented and therefore a conversion cannot be certain. Differences between <BR/>t90 and t68 can be up to 0.01 at temperatures <BR/>of 40 C and above; differences of 0.002-0.007 occur across <BR/>the standard range of ocean temperatures (-10 - 30 C). <BR/>The International Equation of State of Seawater 1980 (EOS-80, UNESCO, <BR/>1981) and the Practical Salinity Scale (PSS-78) were both based <BR/>on IPTS-68, while the Thermodynamic Equation of Seawater 2010 (TEOS-10) <BR/>is based on ITS-90.

The sea surface foundation temperature is the water temperature <BR/>that is not influenced by a thermally stratified layer of <BR/>diurnal temperature variability (either by daytime warming or nocturnal cooling). <BR/>The foundation temperature is named to indicate that it is <BR/>the temperature from which the growth of the diurnal thermocline <BR/>develops each day, noting that on some occasions with a <BR/>deep mixed layer there is no clear foundation temperature in <BR/>the surface layer. In general, sea surface foundation temperature will <BR/>be similar to a night time minimum or pre-dawn value <BR/>at depths of between approximately 1 and 5 meters. In <BR/>the absence of any diurnal signal, the foundation temperature is <BR/>considered equivalent to the quantity with standard name sea_surface_subskin_temperature. The <BR/>sea surface foundation temperature defines a level in the upper <BR/>water column that varies in depth, space, and time depending <BR/>on the local balance between thermal stratification and turbulent energy <BR/>and is expected to change slowly over the course of <BR/>a day. If possible, a data variable with the standard <BR/>name sea_surface_foundation_temperature should be used with a scalar vertical coordinate <BR/>variable to specify the depth of the foundation level. Sea <BR/>surface foundation temperature is measured at the base of the <BR/>diurnal thermocline or as close to the water surface as <BR/>possible in the absence of thermal stratification. Only in situ <BR/>contact thermometry is able to measure the sea surface foundation <BR/>temperature. Analysis procedures must be used to estimate sea surface <BR/>foundation temperature value from radiometric satellite measurements of the quantities <BR/>with standard names sea_surface_skin_temperature and sea_surface_subskin_temperature. Sea surface foundation temperature <BR/>provides a connection with the historical concept of a "bulk" <BR/>sea surface temperature considered representative of the oceanic mixed layer <BR/>temperature that is typically represented by any sea temperature measurement <BR/>within the upper ocean over a depth range of 1 <BR/>to approximately 20 meters. The general term, "bulk" sea surface <BR/>temperature, has the standard name sea_surface_temperature with no associated vertical <BR/>coordinate axis. Sea surface foundation temperature provides a more precise, <BR/>well-defined quantity than "bulk" sea surface temperature and, consequently, is <BR/>more representative of the mixed layer temperature.

Practical Salinity is reported on the Practical Salinity Scale <BR/>of 1978 (PSS-78), and is usually based on the electrical <BR/>conductivity of sea water in observations since the 1960s.
